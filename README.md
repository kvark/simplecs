Simple Entity-Component System in Rust:
  - minimal functionality
  - perfect data representation
  - no unsafe code

`id` crate provides `Id` and `Array` helpers for safer addressing.

`ecs` crate has a simple macro-based ECS.

`secs` crate has a syntax extension (struct decorator) that does the same but with better visibility and generics support.
